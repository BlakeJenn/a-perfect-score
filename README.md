<!-- Overview and how to run application

Musical print shop, A Perfect Score, makes 30,000 sales a year to theater companies nationally, producing top quality musical and opera scores. The only problem is a business run by musicians can, famously, get disorganized pretty quickly! Customers have been asking to find information on scores based on their favorite composers, employees have been wanting to see what scores have the best sales, and higher ups have been wanting to see who their general clientele are. This is where we come in! A database will record the scores they sell, their composers, their various score types (hard copy, paperback, and digital), and their corresponding prices based on format. A Perfect Score will also record their orders and customers to visualize and analyze which types of customers tend to prefer A Perfect Score for their sheet music related needs. 
Depending on their need, customers might be shopping by composer, so recording the composer as their own entity is necessary. A production will typically buy one type of score for the whole cast for ease of communication in making musical cuts, so distinction of score type will be needed. The database will also record their sales so A Perfect Score can know which scores are the most in demand. The user can search for scores associated with a specific composer as well as searching for instances of a particular score being ordered. 
The following code is the database for A Perfect Score. 


The database utilizes SQL for the data initialization and manipulation, MariaDB for the database management system, and Node, Express, Handlebars, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end user interface. To access the database, make sure node, express, and handlebars are properly installed, the correct directory is selected in the Terminal, the proper MariaDB account has run the SQL file, then run node app.js in the Terminal to connect to a server.
